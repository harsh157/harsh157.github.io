I am a machine learning engineer. I have worked on mix of problems, applying techiniques related to Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision in my past experiences. I did Masters in AI from KU Leuven, Belgium. I worked at a startup for 5 years. Here I had end to end responisibility for projects. From developing the prototypes to deploying the models to production and building the systems around it.

I like to work in different domains and solve diverse and challenging problems. I believe mixing multiple domains gives more information and makes the output of solution more rich and informative. For my masters thesis, I combined methods from NLP and Computer Vision to generate caption for images using transformer based models. During my time working at startup, I was responsible for designing and developing machine learning and deep learning systems, running machine learning tests and experiments, and building data processing pipelines.
